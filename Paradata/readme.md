**Why has the resource been created and for what audience?**

This application was created both as an example to how someone with little to no development skills can easily create an AR application, but also as a way to highlight how augemented reality can be utilized to create hidden stories and contexts.

**How will the resource be put to use? Is it sustainable and accessible?**

This resource will be usefull as a record for if I want to create more AR apps in the future, but also as a way to teach others how they can encorporate AR into their projects. As for sustainablity, it relys on the a few programs that if they were to fail, so to would the process. For example, Vuforia was originally its own seperate program but now is integrated into Unity making it more dependent on Unity remaining available for personal developers. Finally, accessiblity is an interesting topic that I hadn't really considered before, in class we discussed how different types of disabilities can impact the way that we interact with digital history and specifically the idea of does digital history need to be visual. I believe personally, that it is hard to make projects like this accessible to everyone, but coming to terms with that and acknowledging the fact, that my process notes for example are only available in english, on the computer and lack any visual or audio aids to help guide those who need it. By acknowledging these failures future projects can hopefully be more accessible to everyone.

**Why have you chosen to use the approach/methods applied?

While I had originally looked into getting my model 3d printed, I decided on AR because of our inclass discussion about guerilla artists that were using AR to create additions to musuems that the musuems could do nothing about. I loved this idea, so I wanted to explore the technology and see what I could create and hopefully incorporate into my 4th module. I settled on using Unity because not only was it suggested by the professors I also had some friends in game development that had experience with unity that I knew I could rely on if I had any quesitons. 

**What are the basic Steps you followed in putting together the resource?**

*Step One*

I installed the various programs required that are explored and listed in my process notes**

*Step Two*

Following a [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtiUx_szKbI) I created a Unity Project and activated the necessary components for Vuforia. 

*Step Three*

Created the Vuforia Database and imported both it and the asset into my model.

*Step Four*

Fit my asset to my target 

*Step Five*

Finalized all the settings and created my application

**Have you acknowledged Unvertainty in the resource? Where might alternative interpretations have been made or where are such interpretations otherwise available for viewing audiences**

Most of the uncertainty of the resource is addressed in a [previous post](https://github.com/Robert-Oles/Hist3812-Remix/blob/master/Paradata/Paradata.md)
